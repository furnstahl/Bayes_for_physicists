    "A brief, hands-on introduction to the basics of Bayesian statistics in a manner adapted to the general intuition and experience of physicists.  We use a Jupyter notebook with Python (with scipy, numpy, mathplotlib supplemented by specialized packages such as PyMC3) to allow for active visualization of examples, hands-on follow-ups, and readily extended content. You can find the notebooks (labeled BSFP_pn_xxx.ipynb) and associated files at\n",
