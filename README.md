# Bayes_for_physicists
Bayesian statistics for physicists


In the Bayesian_Statistics_for_Physicists directory there is a Jupyter notebook Bayesian_statistics_for_physicists_v3.ipynb, which was presented at the EMMI workshop "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) at the Extremes (ISNET-6)" on October 9, 2018.

This notebook has been split up into separate notebooks for each of the parts for further development, in files starting with "BSFP".
